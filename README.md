# Rose Boy
On April 20, 2000, the famous "The Rose Boy" Ye Yong-Cheng incident occurred in Taiwan. Ye Yong-Cheng was a junior high school boy who enjoyed cooking and weaving. However, he was mocked by his classmates for his traits and even bullied, which made him afraid to go to toilets during class. On this day, he went to the toilet five minutes before class ended as usual, but never returned. His death led Taiwan to pass the Gender Equality Education Law and made Jolin Tsai's same-name song the best song of the year, which everyone remembers and sings...
Bullying stories always happen in the memories of teenagers' school lives. In today's society where gender diversity issues are receiving increased attention, we hope to use VR puzzle game to allow players to immerse themselves in their school memories. Through the unique story of "The Rose Boy", players can learn to respect every individual.
